*VendorList
- vars --> size of array (constant), object/vendor2 array, and a index
- all vars above is private
- have all recommended methods that is provide in the lab

*Application
- Need a input stream
- Need a scanner to read from input stream
- Need a VendorList instance
- Need a string array token separator for vendor2 set up
- need a condition where i don't pick the first line on pswds2.txt cause it's a example
- Now, I need to do a while loop to read all lines from pswds2 and split the lines up and store it in the token split array.
- Then, I use the vendorlist and use the add method to add new vendors that is set up with the token array.
- Pretty much that is it. From here on, all the vendorlist method will be tested
- The rest of the output stream stuff is from the last lab.
